On the completion of a work which has cost both
thought and labour Ι gladly dedicate it to you, to whom indirectly
it owes so much. Many years have passed since the days when Ι

were examined by myself ; the editions and manuscript notes were
open before me all the time I was at work. The large amount of
critical material thus amassed I have endeavoured to put into as
