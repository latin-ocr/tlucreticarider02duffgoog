concise and compressed a form as possible3 though much of this
material needs perhaps to be recorded only once and might be
greatly abridged if it has ever to appear again in a new shape.

The length of the explanatory notes calls Ι fancy for less ex·
cuse. This very year three centuries have elapsed since Lambinus
published the first edition of his Lucretius3 and from that day to
this nothing new and systematieal, nothing that displays pains
andresearch hasbeen done for the elucidation of our author.
Transcendant as are the merits of that illustrious scholar, what
was suited to 1564 can ¹hardly satisfy the wants of 1864. No
defence then is needed for the extent of this division of my
commentary: if it were done over again, more would probably
have to be added than taken away. It will not be so easy
perhaps to excuse the translation. This however is really a part
of the explanatory notes; and if it had been left undone, they ¹
must have been enlarged in many directions. Our author too
unless I am mistaken will admit of being thus treated better than
mosi; and the fashion of literal translations seems to be gaining
ground in this country as well as in Germany and Franoe.

To the advice and friendly assistance of my brother fellow
Mr King, our highest authority in that branch of art, is due the
likeness of the poet which appears on the titlepage. With K. Ο.
Mueller, Emil Braun and other judges he is convinced that the
, original on a blaok agate represents our Lucretius. The style of
artaud the finely formed letters of the name point to the late
republio. Almost unknown then in other respeets, in this he has
been more fortunate even than Virgil, whose so·called pertraits
are all Ι am told late conventional and unreal.

Sincerely yours

THE EDITOR.
