been enlarged by the substance of at least fifty pagos, chiefly through a
somewhat closer printing. Nor does this at all represent the real

rewritten and much that was superfluous or erroneous has been cut

out. Many thousand fresh illustrations have been added. ⁹

brilliant work I have spoken elsewhere. For the general criticism
