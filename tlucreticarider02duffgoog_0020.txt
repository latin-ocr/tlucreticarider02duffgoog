ΟΝ THE FORMATION OF THE TEXT

In Lucretius had come down to us with a text as uniujured as that of
Virgil and a few other ancient writers, he could scarcely have been
reckoned among the most difficult Latin poete. Certainly he would
have been more easy to explain than Virgil for instance or Horace, for
he tells what he has to tell simply and directly, and among his poetical
merits is not included that of leaving his reader to guess which of many
possible meanings was the one he intended to convey. Fortune however
has not dealt so kindly with him. N ot that the great mass of his poem
is not iu a sound and satisfactory state: in this respect he is better off
than many others; but owing to the way in which it has been handed
down, his text has suffered in some portions irreparable loss. Itis now
universally admitted that every existing copy of the poem has come
from one original, which has itself long disappeared.

Of existing manuscripts a fuller account will presently be given:
let it suffice for the moment to say that the two which Lachmann has
mainly followed and which every future editor must follow, are now in
the library of [cyden. One is a folio written in the ninth century, the'
other a quarto certainly not later than the tenth. Large fragments of
one, if not of two others, of the same age as the quarto and very closely
resembling it are also still preserved, partly in Oopenhagen, partly in
Vienna. These manuscripts audet least one more must have lain for
centuries in the monasteries of France or Germany, where they found at
different periods several correctore, more or less competent. Itis to be
presumed then that they had some readers, though few if any traces of
them are to be met with in the voluminous literature of the middle agee.
