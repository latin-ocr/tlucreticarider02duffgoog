first half of the twelfth century had taken the line from the poem itself 3
or had borrowed it from Priscian inst. 1v 27 who cites it with acaci
instead of pipat, the editor of the bibliotheca having thought fit tacitly
to substitute pioni from Lucretius. The latter is proved to be the fact
by Mr Julius Jesscn in the philologus, vol. 30 pp. rao-238: he quotes
what follows from Barthius’ very learned note on Stat. silv. 11776:
‘nec vero cadentibus aut collapsis iam rebus Romanis auctoritatem suam
amisit Lucretius noster, ut videre potes apud Magnentium Rhabanum
praefatione Iaudum Daedalarum Crucis, Gulielmum Hirsaugiensem in
Institutionibus Philosophicis et Astrologiois, Honorium Augustodunen·
sem in Historia Mundi, Ven Bedam Libro de Metris'. Referring to
the only printed edition of this work of Willism of Hirschau, who lived
from loreto 1091, he shews that Honorius copied from him the passage
in question, and that William cites it thus: ‘Ex insensili credas sensile
nasci', getting it clearly then from Priscian. Hrabanus Maurus and
Beda seem just as little to have known Lucretius at first hand. [Hermes
vol. 8 p. 332, it is said that in Brit. Mus. ms. 377 (13th century) of
Daniel de Merlai’s Philosophia, in p. 90 a, Lucretius is quoted]

In Italy he was even more completely unknown. A catalogue which
Muratori antiq. 111 p. 820 assigns to the tenth century, proves that the
famous library of Bohbio contained at that time libram lucretii 13 but
before the fifteenth no Italian poet or writer shews any knowledge of
him whatever. In the year 1414 the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini went
as apostolic secretary to' the council oi Constance and remained on this
side the Alps in different countries‚ Switzerland Germany Franco and
England, until 1420, with one short interval passed in Milan and
Mantua. During these years he procured from various monasterias
many most important Latin works hitherto totally unknown in Italy:

Among these was a manuscript of Lucretius, obtained apparently fro'rn
'some German monastery either by him or his companion Bartholomew
of Montepulciano, about 1417 as his letters seem to indicate, and trans·
mitted the same year to his intimate friend the Florentino Nicolo Nic-
coli, a most zealous scholar and patron oi the revived classical studies.
This manuscript, which Poggio wrongly supposed to be only a part of the
poem, has itself disappeared, but was the parent of every copywritten
during the loth century, that is to say of every one now extant with the
exception of those specified above: it must have very closely resembled
the Leyden folio. ‘Et te, Lucreti, longo post tempore tandem Oivibus
et patriae reddit habere suae' says Londinus in his poem in praise of
Poggio. Niccoli having such a treasure in his hands was in no hurry to
part with it. We find Poggio writing to him in December 1429 to
remind him that he had kept his Lucretius twelve years A few days
later it is ‘you have had Lucretius now for fourteen years 3 I want to read
