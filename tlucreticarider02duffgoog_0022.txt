him, but cannot get him; do you wish 10 keep him another ten yearsl'
He had already tried in vain what coaxing could do: 110 promises him
at one time to send the book back in fifteen days, at another time in one
month, if he will only let him have it fer 00 long ; but feels sure his
book will come 10 him at the Greek calenda. Much 00 Niccoli loved
Poggio, he loved still more to have the sele possession ef a newly die
covered Latin poet, and Ι doubt whether Poggio saw his Lucretius at all
events before his return from Reme 10 111010οο0 10 1434. Niccoli died
in 1437 and left behind him a manuscript written by his own hand and
new in the Laurentian library, the truest representative ef Poggio's lost
original, as is abundantly proved hythe critical netes 01 the present
edition Between this date and that 01 the earliest printed editions a
knowledge of the poem was diffused through Italy by many incorreot
copies Eight of these, including Nicoclis, are preserved in the lauren-
tian library, all 01 which Ι have examined‚ two with care, as being 01 00
small importance for the text; six are in the Vatican, all seen by meas
long age as theautumn 01 1849. 01 the copies in England I have had
in my hands at least seven ; ene 01 these belonging 10 001 Cambridge
library has been open before me the whole time I was writing my oriti-
001 notes. These manuscripts which have been 01 any importance in
forming the text will be more fully spoken 01, 01101 the printed editions
have been discussed

The editio princeps, 01 which only three copies 010 known, was
printed about 1473 by Ferendus 01 Β100010. Ι1 10 the only one of the
early editions which I do 001 possess 3 Ι have had to trust therefore to
the very unskilful collatien 01 Gerard at the end 01 the Glasgow edition
01 Wakefield. As it was printed from a manuscript a good deal 001-
rected‚ but yet inferior 10 such amended copies as the Cambridge 1110101
instance or that which Ι call Flor. 31, it is 01 little importance in the
history 01 the text: 01 101 less than the two next editions, since they by
accident came 10 be 1110 foundation 01 the vulgate. The 1011110101 these
was published by Paulus Tridenperger 01 Verona in 1486 ‘die vigesimo
octavo septembris calen octobris'. It was printed from a ms. closely re-
sembling the 0110 written by Niecoli‚ as may be 0000 by the most cursory
inspection 01 my critical 00100. Ι1 10 therefore very rude and inaccurate,
but being less interpolated than the editio princeps or the majority of
existing msa it represents 1110 archetype more faithfully than 111000 de,
though there is hardly a line without seme menstrous blunder. The

next edition was published in Venice ‘per theodorum de ragazonibus de
asula dictum bresanum' 4 september 1495. From some elegiae verses at
the end one Ο. Lycinius would appear to be its editor, 11 editor 110 can
be called ; for it exaetly reproduces for the most part 1110 Verona edition
even in the minutest points ef its perverse punctuation. There are how-
ever throughout the poem not a few differences in the two editions, some
