01 111110, others of greater importance ; for example 1v 125-190 are
wanting in the Verona, but not in the Venice. The reason why 1
dwell on this fact will appear presently.

In December 1500 Α10110 published his first edition of our poem, the
first systematic endeavour to make it intelligible throughout. The editor
was Hieronymus Avancius of Verona, who dates his dedication ‘Kalen-
. dis Martii. nm’, old style I presume‚ and really therefore 150οι an
interval of twenty-two months between the two dates would not be easy
to understand. Avancius is known by other works also, especially the
Aldine edition of Catullus. A slight inspection will shew that he took ‘
either the Verona or the Venice edition, upon which to 101111 his text 3 a
more careful examination will prove that it must have been the latter.
⁸ My critical notes will furnish many other instances; let me here only

, mention that in 111 994 he and Van. have torpedine for cuppedine, while

Ver. reads turpidine5 1011 110 takes from Ven. its remarkable reading
0901100, which Lachmann adopts and wrongly assigns to Marullus: Ver.
follows the Leyden and all other known mss. in reading 0900100 ; 1015 110
and Ven. have the absurd reading 1111111010 101 lorello, where Ver. has the
equally unmeaning 111010. Ven. therefore is the ‘ante impressus' spoken
01 by Aldus. Avancius’ preface shews that 101 his day he was a good
and well-read Latin scholar, and had studied Priscian Nonius and Ma-
crobius for the illustration of his author. Aldus in his prefatory letter
to Albertus Pius confirma this, and says that he knew Lucretius by
heaut, ‘ut digitos unguesque suos'. Avancius in his preface asserta
much the same; and the few critical remarks he there inserts shcw that
this was true at least toa certain extent. At the same time he admits
with a seeming candour that owing to the immense difficulty 01 the
work 110 has left much for others to do. Much indeed he has left un-
001105 and it would have been a herculean task 101 one man fully to cor-
rect the desperately corrupt Venice edition, especially in those days
when there were but few extraneous aids and the art of systematic criti·
cism was still in its infancy, two generations having yet 10 elapse, before
it reached its full growth in the hands 01 the illustrious school of French
critica. What he has done however is very great and entitles him 10
high praise, 11 11 10 indeed his own But this shall be considered pre-
sently. The next edition is that 01 the well-known scholar Ioannes Bap-
tista Pius, published 1511 ‘kal Maii' in his native Bologna. Lucretius'
text is embedded in an enormous commentary which displays amid much
cumbrous learning no slight acquaintance with the Latin poets, several
of which he edited before and after his Lucretius He thus describes
what he has done: ‘contulimus non sine aerumnis vigiliisque diutinis
codicem veneti Hermolai: et Pomponi romani: codicemque nou omnino
malum: qui servatur Mantuae in bibliotheca quadam suburbana: qui
fuit viri non indocti gentis clarissimae Strotiorum. non defuit Philippi
