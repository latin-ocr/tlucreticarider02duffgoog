Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei: nuno collegae: impressus quidem:
sed tamen perpense examinatus. Codri quoque grammatici Bononiensis:
cuius copia mihi per Bartholomeum Blanchinum virum eloquii excultis
simi iacta est: Marullique poetae industria mira castigatum non defuit
exemplar¹ Severo Monaoo Placentino graece latineque perdocto musarum
athleta non gravatim offerente'. He makes no mention at all 01 theman
10 whom he was most indebted, Avancius : for his text is a reprint 01 the
first Aldine, with however not a few changes 01 words or phrases, often
² for the better, often for the worse, either inserted in the text or pro
posed in the notes, and derived it maybe presumed in many cases from
one or other 01 the sources just mentioned. But strange to say when he
makes a change in the text, the lemma 01 his note nearly always con-
tains not this reading, but that 01 Avanoius as 11 he had meant it 10
stand: thus 1 9 he rightly reads diff'uao lamiae3 but hia lemma has dlf-
faso numine with Avancius‚ which the latter however correcta at the
end 01 his Catullus: and he adds ‘sunt qui legunt lamiac’. 15 for
capta he wrongly inserts in the text quodque 3 but his lemma has capta,
and his note rightly explains the construction and makes no mention 01
quodque. 34 his text properly has Reiicit, his lemma Refficit after
Avancius3 35 his text wrongly gives suspirans, the lemma crispatam,
and so throughout the poem. This very singular circumstance I explain
in this way: he was living at Rome when his edition was printed and
seems to have sent the text and commentary separately3 for the book-
seller prints at the end a long page 01 errore with this notice prefixed,
‘Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis bibliopola ad lectorem. contuli
Pii exemplar cum edito Lucretio: labeculasque pauculas notavi cet’
Pius' edition was reprinted by Ascensius in 1514 with not a few
changes in the text, some 01 them taken from the notes.

The next edition must be ever memorable in the history 01 Lucre·
tius, that published by Philip Giunta ‘anno salutis. unxn. mense
martio’. Whether this means 1513 new style I cannot tell, but I
know that he dates a Gellius and a Romualdi vita as published in
January 1513, ‘Leone pont. max. christianam ΕΡ. moderante' and
‘Leonis X anno primo’. Now Leo X only became pope in March 01
that year3 so that here he must be speaking 01 1514; and in Florence
at all events this mode 01 dating seems to have been in common use.
The editor was Petrus Candidus who, great and important as the cor-
rections are which he has introduced, has yet used a copy 01 the first
Aldine upon whioh to make them, though he has never mentioned the
name 01 Avancius. It seems to have been the practice 01 those times
to take at least whatever was printed without acknowledgment: thus
Giunta regularly made booty 01 Aldus, Aldus 01 Giunta in turn.
What is said in the present case is grounded on a close inspeetion 01
the two volumes Candidus, where he does not designedly leave him,
