the capture of his native city he was brought to Italy, probably to
Ancona He received his training however in Florence, and he found
·a Maecenas in Lorenao de' Medici. Though he never printed anything
on Lucretius, his manuscript emendations appear to have been well
known during his life, and a copy of the poet 10 have been found on him
at his death: ‘ex miseranda illa in modiis Cecinae undis Latinarum
musarum iactura cladeque insigni unus est Lucretius receptus’ says Can·
didus in his preface ; and his friend Petrus Crinitus in his de honesta
disciplina xv 4, published in 1504, but mostly written it would seem
before Marullus' death, after well refuting an alteration of his which
shall presently be referred 10, adds ‘quae ab eius quoque sectatoribus
receptarunt pro verissimis'. This intense love 01 Lucretius he seems
Δ only 10 have conceived in the latter years of his 1110. Candidus, whose
preface full of feeling shews that he greatly loved Marullus and deeply
deplored his untimely end, strives to make the most of what he did: he
says ‘Lucretianae adeo veneris peromnem aetatem studiosus fuit, ut
’ cet! But 11110 must be an exaggeration: the first edition 01 1110 poems,
published without a date, but not later than 1490, containing only two
books 01 epigrams, shews so far as Ι 0011 000 110 trace of any acquaintance
with Lucretius. Catullus is chiefly imitated even in the elegiam, and
next to him Tibullus and Horace. Six pages from the beginning there
is a poor poem 0f eight lines ‘de poetis Latnis' [sic], in which he says
that Tibullus Maro Terence Horace Catullus, each 111 his kind, are
the only good Latin poete: Hos 11 qaia 111101 caeteros portet 10100,
0110101 qaam 11010101 11011111. Τ110 Roman editions of 1490 and 1493
