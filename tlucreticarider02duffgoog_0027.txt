inserts two new verses in the poem ‘de poetis Latinis’ spoken of above,
Natura magni versibus Lucretii Lepore musaeo illitis, the best in the
poem and recalling musaeo contingens cuncta lepore. Crinitus l.l xxm
7 quotes this poem and mentions a conversation he had with Marullus
in which ‘iactum est iudicium nuper a nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis
egregie perfectum et prudenter ’, and Ovid audather poets are blamed3
and then it is added ‘itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes inquit [Marul-
lus]; sed hi maxime probandi pro suo quisque genere Tibullus Horatius
Catullus et in comoedia Terentius. Vergilium vero et Lucretium edis·

striking interpolation. After 1 15 the J untine first inserted the v.
I lkoebriaqrcc tuis omnis nature animantum, which long kept its place in
the common editione. Lachmann of course attributes it 10 Marullus, as
do most editors. Lambinus says of it ‘neque eum Naugerius neque
Pontanus habuerunt. Marullus unus vir doctus ex auctoritate veteris
cuiusdam codicis, quemadmodum mihi religiose asseveravit Donatus
Ianottus, nobiseum restituit. amicus quidam meus ingenio et doctrina
praestantissimus putat esse ab ipso Marullo factum cet! What his
authority is for that which he says of Pantanus I do not know, but Nau·
gerius editor of the Aldine of 1515 properly omits the line, though he
in general minutely copies the J untine. Now this line is written by the
band of Angelo Politian in the margin of a manuscript which belonged
to him and forms xxxv 29 of the Laurentian library. Politian died in
September 1494, when Marullus could hardly yet have done much for
Lucretius3 and besides this as be had been long the deadly enemy of
Politian, it is not likely the latter would have inserted in bis manuscript
one of his verses. I infer therefore that it is Politian's own ; and as
Candidus says in his preface that be collated all the ‘vetusta exemplaria'
in Florence‚ he could not have neglected this manuscript which was
then in the famous conventual library of San Marco. I conclude therefore
that Candidus' taking it from the margin of Politian’s ms. is the right
explanation of Ianottus' assertion that Marullus got it from an ancient
codex. Itis quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it himself from
this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately after Politian's decease,
and thus robbed him of his verse after death, as heis said to have
robbed him of his bride during life. Naugerius has in his first page
another variation from the J untine, but that a perverse one: in 1 7 he
reads Adventuque tuo and joina it with what follows. This corruption
Ι believe to proceed from Marullus3 for his hymn 10 the sun contains a
passage evidently imitated from Lucretius: Cum primum tepidi stab
tempora verae favoni Aura suum terris genitalem crescitur auctum:
Adventuque dei penetentia prato coloret : As pecudum penus omae viget,
gentes emec virorum Perculsi leemas cani dulcedine memes. I can
sbew in other cases that Marullus corrupted Lucretius, where he has not
