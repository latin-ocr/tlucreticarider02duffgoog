been followed by Avancius 01 Candidus: vr 650-652 are quite correotly
given by Avancius, and in his learned prefaoe he says with reference
to 652 Nec 1010 para cet. ‘totus prima brevi, quia quoti redditivus est '. “
Crinitus 1.1. xv 4 quotes 650 651 rightly, andadds ‘quain re gramma
ticorum nobis authoritas patrocinatur, quando et 0001001000 01 millam)
0100 probe dicitur: partem 00οῖ1001000 inquit Nonius nove positum est
a Lucretio pro minima, ne quis forte paulo incautius atque audacius
a veteribus decedat. quae a me vel ob eam rationem sunt adnotata,
quoniam Marullus Bizantius aetate nostra, vir alioqui diligens, paulo
improbius delere haec 01 0110 pro ingenio subdere tentavit; quae ab eius
queque sectatoribus recepta sunt pro verissimis ’. Candidus gives these
two verses rightly and says in note at end of J unt. ‘citatur Nonio locus' :
he has gotthis clearly from Crinitus, who in the same chapter correotly
quotes and illustratas 1 640 emmae procia cet. which the Italian mss
and editions had corrupted: this 100 Candidus took from him: for Marul-
lus appears to have read eram pravior Graios inter as does Pius ip his
notes, and Gryphius 01 Lyons. Again vr 332 Avancius rightly gives
per raro 0100001, Candidus perversely after Marullus per operta .· see his
note. But fifty instances like the last might be quoted Candidus has
also missed some of the best 01 Μο101100’ conjectures: see for instance
notes 1 10 1 1013 where I have got from the margin 01 000 01 the Floren-
1100 mss. perhaps the most brilliant example of 1110 01111001 acumen.
Then again unless I greatly err I have shewn in my notes that Gifanius
in preparing his edition had before him a copy 01 the Venice ed. of 1495,
lent 10 him by the zealous scholar Sambucus, as he testifies both in his
preface to Sambucus and in his address 10 the reader. In the former he

t says ‘exemplum Lucretii ad 000 dedisti, non illum quidem calamo exa·

ratum, sed ita vetustum et idoneum, 01 vicem optimi manuscripti fuerit
’ siquidem in 00 vidi omnium paene mendorum origines, quae magnam
partem a Michaele Marullo, 00100 immutationes in eo adscriptae erant
omnes, primum parta, mox admiserunt Florentini cet.': in the address
he speaks 01 the ‘Sambuci liber quem ipsius Marulli manu adnotatum
magno pretio vir ille praestantissimus paravit ². Why then Lachmann
p. 6 should write ‘neque enim facile Gifanio credere possum Marulli
ipsius manu annotatum 101000 illud exemplar impressum quod se ab
Iohanne Sambuco utendum accepisse scribit’ I cannot comprehend.
(11100100000001010000101031013, but at the same time a most astute'
man. Why should he tell a gratuitous falsehood which Sambucus would
at once detectl He was writing only two generations after. Marullus’
death 3 and even if Sambucus gave his money for what was not the
handwriting 01 Μο101100, 11 was at least a genuine copy of his notes.
But notes 1 furnish abundant proof of what I say: see 101 instance those
101806 11 16 v 44 and especially 111 994. It appears then that Avan-
cius got from Marullus much which the J untine does not record, and on
