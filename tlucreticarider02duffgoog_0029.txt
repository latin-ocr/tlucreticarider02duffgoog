10 INTRODUOTION

the other hand, that Candidus took from Avancius without acknowledg-
ment much that Lachmann and others assign to Marullus. Candidus,
as Ι have said above, formed his text on a copy of the first Aldine: in
doing this h'e must have had before him another edition with the ms.
notes of Marullus, perhaps the very one which he tells us was found on
him at his death. If now all that is common to the first Aldine and the
J untine comes from Marullus, as Lachmann maintains‚ surely Candidus
must have been struck with this coincidence and would have recorded
it against Avancius the editor of the great rival publisher. Yet Avan-
cius did borrow largely, very largely from Marullus, especially in the case
of interpolated verses made by the latter. Howis this to be explainedl
Evidently even before his death Marullus' labours on Lucretius were
known; and probably there were more copies than one of these, the one
not always agreeing with the other. On this point compare notes l to
1 ecl-627, where Candidus makes some perverse transpositione cf
verses, on the authority of Marullus he says in his note at the end ; but
the learned annotator of one of the Iaurcntian mss. states that some put
551-564 aiter 57 6, and adds ‘verum Marullo parum referre videtur
quomodo legatur ’. This annotator and Avancius Pius Candidus
Gifanius can hardly all have had the same copy: perhaps all were
different. Avancius then may have had his notes in the very copy of
Ven. on which he formed his text ; and may have looked on them as
public property which he might make use of without acknowledgment
according to the practice of the time ; for neither Pius nor Candidus
acknowledges in his turn what he got from Avancius; nor does
Naugerius the editor of Ald. 2 say a syllable of Candidus whose edition
he copied with few variatione.

But Lachmann to 111 98 cites in proof of his charge that Avancius
was a dishonest plagiary three interpolated verses which doubtlcss were
composed by Marullus and are corruptly given in Ald. l. In notes
1 to 111 98 Ι 'have attempted to shew from Gifanius that Marullus
perhaps wrote putarit, and that Avancius intended to read the same:
Avancius was probably as good a Latin scholar as Marullus, if less
versed in Lucretius. In the line inserted aiter 1v 102 multae for maltos
may be an error of the printer or an oversight of Avancius. In that
inserted after 1v 532 there can be little doubt that he purposely wrote

’ sais, imagining thatcra's was a plural. The correcting of texts was then
in its infancy‚ and Avancius had so grievous a task before him in making
sense out of the monstrously corrupted Venice edition, that much must
in fairness be excuscd: we cannot tell what were the exact relations
between him and Aldus and his printers. At the end of his Catullus
published two years later he has taken occasion to give four pages
of Lucretiam criticism‚ in which he has proposed many excellent altera·
tions of his former text, though Ι do not find that any editor before me
