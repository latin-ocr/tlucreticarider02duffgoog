has noticed these which are very important 101 his reputation: see notes
l to 11 422 and other passages. The inierence then Idraw 11010 all this
is that both Avancius and ¹Marullus did much 101 Lucretius, Marullus
donbtless more than Avancius ; that much which 10 peculias to the
Juntine is not 11010 Marullus, and much 01 111101 Marullus did is
not in the J untine. Between them they vastly improved a grievously
corrupt text; and though they introduced many perversities, we ought

in simple justice 10 take 1010 consideration only what is good. In my
notes 101 obvious reasons, when Ald. l and J unt. agree in a reading, Ι
mention boch3 when a reading is peculiar to Ald. l, Ι 000130 11 10
Avancius by name ; when it first appears in J unt, 1 still say J 1101,
though it is always to be inierred that the best readings are most
a likely due to Marullus. By assigning 10 him all alike one would often
be doing him less, sometimes more than justice.

[In my second edition however Ι was ableto throw fresh light cn the
history and criticism 01 Lucretius’ text by the undoubted corrections 01
Pontanus and Marullus, still existing among the books and manuscripts
01 Peter Victorius which have formed 101 centurias so valuable a portion
01 the Munich library. They were examined by me and copied out in .
the summer 01 1865, my attention having been directed to them by a
Goettingen program 01 Ρ101. Sauppe. The learned writer informs us
that he had examined the Munich ms. 01 Lucretius 0011000111001-
reeted throughout by some Italian scholar. Where Candidus the editor
01 the J 001100 mentions in his 0010 0 reading 01 Marullus, this reading
invariably appeared among these corrections. From this and other
indicatione he concluded, and the conclusion seemed most reasonable,
that these were the very corrections 01 Marullus which Candidus had
used 101 his edition. He makes the probable suggestion that the long
connexion 01 Victorius with the Giuntas would readily explain his
possession 01 0 manuscript which had belonged to that firm.

At Munich through the courtesy 01 the librarian I had the 1011 00001
the following important documenta: 1. the manuscript just mentioned:
2. 0 copy 01 the Venice edition 01 1195111111 corrections by Pontanus in
the handwriting 01 Victorius who describes them in the first page as
‘emendationes ex Pontani codice testantis ipsum ingenio eas expromp
sisse': 3. another copy 01 the same edition likewise corrected through·
ont by the hand 01 Victorius who says at the end ‘contuli cum duobus
codicibus, altero Ioviani Pontani, altero vero Marulli poetae Bizantii,
impressis quidem, sed ab ipsis non incuriose, ut patet, emendatis, quos
commodum accepi ab Andrea Cambano patritio Florentino unxx.
, Idibus Martiis. Petrus Victorius'. What the printed edition was
11010 which he copied these emendations 01 Marullus Ido not know:
very likely it was this Venice edition 110011 which must have had a large
circulation and was the very edition containing Marullus’ notes which
