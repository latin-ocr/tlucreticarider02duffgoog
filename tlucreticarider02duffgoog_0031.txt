12 INTRODUCTION

Gifanius made use of, as has been already told. Victorius says of grando
in v 1192 ί9100ιί0 in Pont libro': now since not only the Venice
edition, but the Verona and first Aldine have procido, and also the Brea
cian as Ι learn from Earl Spencer's librarian, Fontanus must have used
some printed edition now unknown. The pains which so eminent a
scholar as Victorius has taken in copying out twice the emendations of
Pontanus and once those of Marullus would prove ¹the high estimation in
which those two learned men must have been held when he was 0 young
man of twenty. As he has also filled a copy of the J untine with long
parallel passages from the Greek, he must himself at one time have
contemplated an elaborate edition of the poet and has to be added to
the long list of scholars with whom this remained an unaccomplished
design. ι

We have then an undoubted copy of what Pontanus himself asserted
to be his own original emendations ; and aa they are accurately repeated
by Victorius in his second copy, if we subtract these we have in what
remains the undoubted corrections of Marullus. Now the latter with
only a few variations, easily to be accounted for as being earlier thoughts
or in other ways, all reappear among the alterations of the Munich ms.
which are however much more numerous. When we consider all this,
and rememhar that wherever Candidus in his notes mentions the name
of Marullus, the reading which he assigns to him is found here3 that he
tells us in his preface his text is grounded mainly on the revisions of ⁸
Pontanus and Marullus, the latter more especially; that, as the present

’ edition will demonstrate, the numerous readings which first appear in the

J untine, good bad and indifferent, where not taken from what we now
know to be those of Pontanus, nearly always agree with the corrections ι
of this manuscript, and finally that Candidus not unfrequently gives a
new reading peculiar to this of all manuscripts known to me, as in his
note 00 v 826 where he mentions pariendo as a variation, we may fairly
conclude that Candidus in preparing his text had the use of this corrected
manuscript, and that the corrector was Marullus. It would be natural
too to conclude that this is his own copy amended hy his own hand 3 and ’

⁸ for the most part Ι (10 not doubt that this is sc. However they cannot

all have been written at the same time, as the ink differs in different
places; and as so many of the emendations agree with those of Pontanus,
it seems not improbable that the ms was in his possession before it carne
into 01ιο hands of Marullus. As the Italian handwritings of that age re-
semble eaoh other so much, at least to our eyes, the writing of the pupil
may not have differed much from that of the master. However that ¹
may he, we must conclude that the corrections common to both belong
to Pantanus, as he was the elder and we saw above that he olaims them
for his own, and the scholar would naturally borrow from the master.
The emendations 000 of Fontanus, valuable as many of them are, have
