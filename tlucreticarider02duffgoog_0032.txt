TO NOTES Ι 13

the appearance of being earlier and more rudimentary than those of tho
other: he not unfrequently too sees that something is wanting and says
‘fragmentum', where the latter supplies a whole verse with more or less
success. The scholar therefore completed what the master commenced3
and the emendation of Lucretius links their names together not less
honourably than does the verse we quoted from Ariosto. Upon the whole
this fresh information has greatly raised my estimate of both, especially
of Marullus. His industry is at least as conspicuous as his sagacity: he
has evidently carefully collated manuscripts and editions and gathered
materials from all accessible sources. Throughout the poem the many
verses omitted in the Munich manuscript are supplied with unfailing
diligence. He evidently was acquainted with several of the existing
Florentine manuscripts, among others that of Niccoli Ibelieve‚ as well
as that of his enemy Politian, and Flor. 31 whose readings Lachmann
so strangely assigns to the notary Antonius Marii. Upon the whole he
must be placed as an amender of Lucretius immediately after Lambinus
and Lachmann, if not indeed in the same front rank, when we consider
the circumstances of his age and the imperfection 01 his materials3 and
Pontanus perhaps may rank after him. Lambinus, as well as Avancius
and Naugerius editor of the second Aldine, must have had access to
some copy 01 Pontanus’ corrections.

What Ι said of Marullus in my first edition with much more imper-
fect materials from which to draw conclusione, I find now confirmed in
essential points. There were in circulation different copies 01 Marullus’
emendations3 Gifanius had access to one 01 these: see notes 1 10 1 274
1v 1005, as well as 11 16 125 465 111994v201 1151 vr 25: what Ι in-
ferred from his own poems is borne out by 11 719 and 119 and some
other passages: the assertion 01 Crinitus quoted above that Marullus had
corrupted vr 651 652 is fully confirmed here: Marullus for the correct
multesima most unskilfully proposes 11111110 estimo 3 and for 1010 reads
sit: the latter Candidus adopts. In other cases his more mature judg-
ment as seen in the Munich manuscript doubtless differed from his earlier
notions. A man who studied Lucretius so long and earnestly cannot
fail to have often changed his mind on further reflexion and with new
sources of information. Candidus does not by any means follow Ponta-
nus or Marullus in his orthography: that is formed as I proved in my
first edition mainly on Avancius. In many cases they might have taught
him better ; to avoid for instance such embellishments as his 1111111111,
uirentem. He rightly however avoids such barbarisms as the hymbrae
and syloa of Marullus. From succus l ’11111 0101111 and the like, which
the latter carefully introduces we may infer that he and Pontanus had
some share in bringing such corruptions into common use. The careful

collation which I have given in this ¹edition of the emendations of
Fontanus and Marullus will prove their importance, and shew how rash
