and unfounded Lachmann's procedure is in assigning everything that is
new in the J untine to Marullus: even in the many instances where he
and I are in agreement, it must be remembered that he speaks without
authority, while I possess the testimony of Marullus himself]

The J untine closes the first great epoeh of improvement in the text
of Lucretius: the second Aldine edited by the well-known scholar An-
drew Naugerius and dated ‘mense ianuario mcxv! is for the most part
a mere reprint of it without however one word of acknowledgment ae
cording to the usage of the time. Yet the changes are not few, mostly
for the better, not always: two instances are given above from the first
page, the one a gross corruption, the other a right rejection of an inter-
polation For the next fifty years Ald. 2 appears to have been the model
edition. Gryphius of Lyons published several texts, three of which
I have before me: they generally follow Naugerius, but not always,
often recurring to Avancius. Those of 1534 and 1540 have many mar·-
ginal readings, most of them taken from Avancius or the notes of Pius,
a few from sources not known to me: see notes l t019770fflciatque.
Yet even these two editions do not always agree with each other. '

Little advance however was made on the J untine before Dionysius
Lambinus. He dates his address to Charles IX l November 1563 and
afterwards speaks of his first edition as published in that year3 though

the title-page of my copy has 1564. Lambinus was among the most
illustrious of the great Latin scholare who studied and taught at Paris
in the sixteenth century. His knowledge of Cicero and the older Latin
writers as well as the Augustan poets has never been surpassed and
rarely equalled. Whoever doubts that the nicest critical and gramma
tical questions can be expressed in Ciceronian Latin without effert or
affectation, let him study the commentaries of Lambinus. Scaliger says
of him ‘Latine et Romane loquebatur optimeque scribebat’: his ease
and readiness are astonishing. He made use he tells us of five mss:
four of these appear to have been Italian mss. of the fifteenth century:
the fifth, of which he used a collation by Turnebus, and which he calls
the Bertinian, was the same as the Leyden quarto. In his preface and
throughout the work he acknowledges his obligations to Turnebus and
Auratus. His Lucretius is perhaps the greatest of his works: there was
more to be done here, and therefore he has done more. He had more-
over a peculiar admiration for this author, of whom in the prefaee to his
third edition he says ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui hodie exstant et
qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus et purissimus, idem· η
que gravissimus atque ornatissimus Lucretius est'. If his boast that he
has restored the text in 800 places goes beyond the truth, though I am
not sure that it does, yet the superiority of his over all preceding texts
can scarcely be exaggerated; for the quickness of his intellect united
with his exquisite knowledge ofthe language gave him great power in
