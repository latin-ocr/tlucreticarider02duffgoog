the field 01 conjecture, and 101 nearly three centurias his remained the
standard text. Lachmann says he did much less than Marullus. But
so iar 00 there is truth in this, it is merely saying that the one lived
before the other: nine tenths 01 what Marullus affected, Lambinus could
have done currente calamo 5 but Ι doubt whether Marullus could have
accomplished one tenth 01 what Lambinus succeeded in doing. Lach-
mann accuses him 01 strange levity and rashness. But it must be re-
memhered that in a short 1110 he got through an amazing amount 01
work in 001110111111)1 with the wants 01 his age. Ηο only gave two years
and a 11011 10 1110 brilliant edition 01 1110 whole 01 Cicero: and probably
did not spond many more months 011 his Lucretius than Lachmann spent
years Nor was it possible in that age even 101 0 Lambinus to appre-
hend the true relation oi the mss. 01 Lucretius to one another. His
copious explanatory and illustrative commentary however calls 101 un-
qualified eulogy, and has remained down to the present day the great
original storehouse, from which all have horrowed who have done
anything 01 value 101 the elucidation 01 their author. Scaliger says
‘Lambinus avoit fort peu de livres': 11 00 he made good 110001 them,
as his reading is as vast as it is accurate, and its results are given in a
style 01 unsurpassed clearness and beauty. His notes observa the mean
between too much and too little: he himself calls them 111101, while his
thankless countrymen, thinking however more perhaps 01 his Horace
than his Lucretius, have made 1011011111 0116 1111111101 classica] terms 10
express what is diffuse and tedicus. Α second and much smaller edition
with only a few pages 01 110100, but with many variations from the first,
was published in 1565.

Scarcely could this first edition have issued 110111 1110 press, when the

well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertus Gilanius 01 Buren began :

with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and convert it
10 his own purposes. His Lucretius was printed by Plantin 01 Antwerp
in 1566 00 stated at the end, though 01 two copies before me the title-
page 010110 has on it 1566, the other 1565, which is the date 01 his own
address to Sambucus, and 01 1110 two privilegia at the end ; 1011110
March 1564 01 the first must be old style, as it is later than the Febru-
ary 1565 011110 second. He brought nothing new to his task, except
the ms. notes 01 Marullus in theold Venice ed. fully spoken 01 above3
101 the emendations and readings 01 Antonius Goldingamus homo
Anglus, which 110 speaks 01 111 his preiace, and 111000101οε libri and the
like which occur throughout his hook are mere blinds to conceal his
1110110 from Lambinus. The way in which 110 contrives at once to bestow
empty praise on this scholar and yet to extenuate his merits and put him
as a commentator 01 Lucretius on the same level with other learned
men, Turnebus 101 instance, 100 marvel 01 0011110110οε. In the preface to
his third ad. Lambinus states the truth with great terseness: ‘omnia
