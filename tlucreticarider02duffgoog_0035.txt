1010 quae in 00 Lucretio recta sunt, mea sunt; quae tamen iste 001 01-

Yet 00 great was 1110 011111 with which all this was done that he deceived
many and was thought to be a rival worthy 01 Lambinus. contrary 10 =
· what many believe, the age loved brief notes ; and his were brief, 1110
other’s copious. Even the great critic 01 that generation J oseph Scali-
ger, who well knew the character of the man and accused him 01 gross

deceit towards himself, says ‘Gifanius estoit docte, son Lucrece est tres
“’ bon'. Lambinus however knew the truth, and bis wratb was as signal
as the provocation In 1570 he brought out a third edition greatly im-
proved and enlarged3 much 01 the additional matter however consists in
invectives against the aggressor. In a long preface of great power and
beauty 01 style he states bis wrongs. There and throughout his commen-
tary the whole Latin language, rich in that department, is ransacked for
terms 01 000111 and contumely. The same charges are repeated in a bun-
dred' different shepes with curious copiousness and variety 01 expression.
Gifanius with consistent cunning attempted no public reply to all this.
Many years afterwards, when Lambinus had long been dead, a new edi·
tion of the other's book was brought out at Leyden in 1595, 111 which
many additions are made 10 the brief notes, but not a word is said 01 the
charges brought against him by Lambinus. He was rewarded for his
reticence, and for 0 century or more opinion was divided as to whether
he or Lambinus did more lor Lucretius. In private he corresponded
with the cankered and unhappy Muretus: the two exchanged futile
charges of dishonesty against the dead critic, who was far 100 genuine
a scholar to be capable 01 being a plagiary. Lachmann 00 010111 with
Avancius has nothing 10 say 01 this much more fiagitious case: ‘quiquo
iure’ 110 observes ‘aut Lambinum aut alios compilasse dictus 00001 non
quaesivi'. Gifanius had no business whatever 10 edit a poet: he was
without poetical taste and grossly ignorant of metre.

For a century 01101 Lambinus nothing was done for Lucretius: the
common editions followed either Lambinus or Gifanius. In 1658 the
singular labours 01 Gassendi were given to the world. Deeply versed in
the works 01 the fathers and the philosophy 01 all ages down 10 1110 101001
discoveries 01 Ι)00001100 he devoted himself with the zeal of a disciple to
the dogmas of Epicurus. The two first 01 his huge folios are given to
this philosophy, and 0 large portion 01 them to the exposition of Lucre-
tius. Much that is curicus may be gathered from them, and I have
perused them with attention ; but 10 say the 110111 Ι have not found
much to my purpose in them. The author was utterly devoid 01 the
critical faculty, and all that is of value in him on this head is borrowed
from Lambinus: as well as the most 000101 01 his illustrations: his cor-
rections 01 the text are almost without exception worthless In the 17111
century several distinguished scholars, Salmasius J. F. Gronovius Nic.
