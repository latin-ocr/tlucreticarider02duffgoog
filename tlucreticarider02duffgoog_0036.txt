Heinsius Isaac Vossius, turned their attention 10 1111010110ος but their
labours were only desultory. Of the ms. notes by 1110 two last which
are in my possession 1 will speak afterwards In 1662 Tanaquillus
Faber or Tanneguy Lefebvre published at Saumur a text of Lucretius
followed by mundationes and 0010100. Ηο was 0 010101 11111 1010 man,
who seemed 10 think such work rather beneath him 3 he takes 0010 how-
ever to inform his readers that he spent but little time or paine on it,
and had only Lambinus and Gifanius before him, though he owed nothing

to either. The 1111111 10 that without Lambinus he could not have ad· ·

vanced a step: elever man that he is, he affords a good 111001 how much
Latin scholarship had deteriorated 10 Franoe during the century between
him and Lambinus. Of Pareus, Nardius, Fayus nothing need be said.

Had Bentley in 1689 01 1690 suooeeded in 1110 efforts to obtain for
the Bodleian Isaac Vossius' famous library, he might have anticipated
what Lachmann did by a century and 0 half. As 110 was at that very
11010 working hard at Lucretius, if he had once got into his hands the
two 0100 now at Leyden, he would at a glance have seen their 10111011
0000 and would scarcely have failed to complete the edition which he
was 11100 meditating. The great knowledge 01 Epicurus’ system which
he displayed two years later in his Boyle lecturos and his zeal for the
recently published Principia 01 Newton would have aided himin ex·
pounding the 100010 01 the poet This however was not 10 bo; but 1110
marginal 00100 published in the Glasgow edition 01 Wakefield prove
what hc could have done, if he had 3000 00 with his design. 1 cannot
doubt that Lucretius would have suited him better 11100 Horace, and
offered a fairer field 101 the exeroise 01 his critical divination.

In 1695 there 00010 11001 the Oxford press a Lucretius edited not by
Bentley, but by Thomas Oreech Fellow 01 All Souls, 0 man 01 sound
001100 and good 10010, 11111 10 judge from his book 01 somewhat arrogant
and supercilious temper. The text 10 nearly always 0 10111011001100 01
000 01 other 01 the editions of Lambinus: 011011 0111101010 indeed he seems
in his 11101000 10 look upon 00 unworthy 01 him. His notes 010 10 01001
cases mere abridgements 01 those 01 Lambinus or copied 110111 Faber,
and his illustratione are usually borrowed from the former. All this he
does 00 11 11 were a matter 01 0011100, 001 thinking it necessary either 10
avow or conceal his obligations. His interpretatio 10 his own: how 101
11 10 01 assistance to a student must depend upon what 110 000110 101 in
it. His Lucretius however owing to the clearness and brevity 01 the

00100 has continued to be the popular 000 11001 that time 10 the present.

The worthy London bookseller Jacob Tonson published in 1712 0
finely printed text 111111 10110110 readings at the end collected 11001 many
quarters with a great deal 01 trouble, some 01 101110, 10001 quito worth-
less This I chiefly mention on account 01 what follows. In 1725
Sigebert Havercamp Professor at Leyden gave to 1110 world his variorum
