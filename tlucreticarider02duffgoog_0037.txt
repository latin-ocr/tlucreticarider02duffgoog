edition in two large volumes. Though his reputation has never been
great, my readers will hardly perhaps be prepared for what Iam going
to say. As Professor in Leyden he had the full use of the two Vossian
mss. there, the main foundation of a genuine text: how did he use this
advantage, which in profession he makes so much of l The chief feature
of his edition is a vast and cumbrous apparatus of various readings,
derived from about thirtyone sources professedly distinct. Of these
thirtyone twenty-two 000 simply the various readings of the London
edition just mentioned which Havercamp has taken and tumbled into
his own without changing the notation. Most of these are of the most
futile nature, taken from worthless editions which reprint or ignorantly
depart from those of Giuntu, Aldus, Lambinus or Gifanius, such as that
01 Ρο0000, Gryphius, Fayus, Nardius and the French translator the
Baron de Contures: themora worthless the authority, the more fully it
seems 10 be given. There are also some collations of the mss. of Vossius
and that in the Bodleian which it did the London hookseller credit to
get together. The nine remaining authorities are these: a certain Busil
edition of 1531, its marginal readings, a collation of the Verona edition
01 1486, 0100 jottings in its margin from three unknown mss, 0 second
collation of the Bodleian, and lastly the two all-important Leyden mss
The two last are the only authorities he has collated himself. How has
he performed this taskl he has 001 noted one reading in three, the most

important variatione he usually omits; and the readings he gives are as

often wrong as right. That which he has horrowed from others and

· thrown in a lump into his edition is for the most part as worthless as

the scribblings of a schoolboy. So incredibly careless is he, that the
Vossian collatione which he borrows from Τοο000 00000 should bethose
of his Leyden mss: see note 1 to v 471 100 0 glaring instance 01 0 false '
reading which he slavishly copies from Tonson and ascribes to his
Leyden quarto. Nay more the Bm of the London edition and his own
X 000 000 and the same Bodleian ms. so that we have this ludi·
crous result, that the same ms. 10 cited twice over 00 two independent
authorities. His various readings are therefore not only cumbrously
inane, but are a snare and delusion, and have led astray those who
like Wakefield have trusted to them. Thus in his hands the two un·
rivalled Leyden mss. have been worse than useless. What he does 111οι-
, 0011 10 always worse done than what he borrows from others, poor 00
that generally is: he has collated 0000 01 the old editions except the
Verona, and that was done for him, and better done than he would have
done it for himself. Nor 000 his explanatory notes much better : he has
heaped together in a crude mass those of the chief editors3 but except in
the case 01 Virgil and Horace and one or two others 01 the best known
poets, indexes to which are in everybody's hands, he has not even sup·
plied the references to Lambinus' learned notes who from the circum-
