’ 01011000 01 his age could not himself furnish them; nay in one case he
has given Lambinus’ own words as those 01 (licere. In bis two bulky

volumes there is not one week's genuine work beyond what scissors and
paste could do: seldom has performance fallen sofar short of profession
and opportunity.

There is nothing to detain us between Havercamp and Wakefield
who in 1796 and 1797 gave his three volumes to the world, rivalling
1110 other's in magnitude. Yet the work, such as it is, ishis own, arrd
is not a mere slothful compilation 110111 others. Gilbert Wakefield pos-
eessed one quality which a critic can ill dispensa with, that of despising
any amount 01 authority which did not rest on some real foundation,
and refusing to admit that, because a reading had appeared in edition
after edition for centurias, it might by that alone claim recognition. He
therefore set about a new revision which was to be based on manuscript
authority alone; but neither his knowledge 1101 his industry nor his
ability nor his taste sufficed for such a work. He professed to collate

. five English mss, among them our Cambridge one, and most 01 theold
editions. This task he executed with incredible carelessness. As he had
the full use 01 the Cambridge ms, one might‘have expected that his
oollation of it would be done with some care ; but itis quite 1111111101
worthy. From this as well as the evidence 01 his own notes and the
nature of the case I infer that his other collations are not more to
be depended upon. Had this labour been faithfully performed, it would
still have been 01 little use, as he had no 11011011 01 the true relation
01 these late mss. 10 0110 another. He lcoked on each as an inde-
pendent authority and thought he could not do wrong, if the words hc
put in his text were found in one 01 other of them. Then he had 10
take from Havercamp the readings of the Leyden mss, and therefore
could gain no 11110 insight into their character. As 110 had no know-
ledge 01 the language 01 philosophy of his author, he undertcok to
explain whatever words he put into his text in long turgid notes of
unmeaning verbiage. His work was got through with a strange precipi-
tancy: when engaged on the first part, he had never read the other parts
of the poem 3 when he came to them, he had forgotten what went before.
Morbidly vain and utterly unconscious of the immeasureable distance
between Lambinus and himself, he assails the most brilliant and certain
emendations 01 the unrivalled scholar in a hideous jargcn and with a
vehemence of abusa that would be too great even for his own errore:
Thus by some fatality 01 other, by its falling into the hands 01 a Gifanius
Havercamp Wakefield instead of those 01 0 Salmasius Gronovius Hein-
sius Bentley, the criticism 01 Lucretius remained 101 0011101100 where it
had been left by Lambinus, nay even retrograded. And yet Wakefield
did display occasional flashes 01 11011νο genius, and 0111 110100 will shew
that 1101 0 few ¹certain corrections are due to him, but from the first to
