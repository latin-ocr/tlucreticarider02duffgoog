20 INTRODUO'I'ION

the last ο1 his 1200 quarto pagos there isnot a single explanation ο1 the
words or philosophy oi his author for which a schoolhoy would thank
him: so incurably inaccurate and illogical was his mind. Yet owing to
the boldness with which he asserted his protensione he was thought even
by scholars to have done something great for his author: he received
complimentary letters imm Heyne and Jacobs, ‘hominibus modestis
et ab omni indicii subtilitate abhorrentibus' ; and more than thirty years
afterwards Forbiger in preparing his compilation for the use oi the
general public took him for his supreme authority. Even later than that
so great a scholar as Ph. Wagner often appeals to him in his notes to
Virgil But though long in coming the avenger was to be,

Already in 1832 Madvig in a short academical program, afterwards
republished among his opuscula, exposed the futility of Wakefield’s
criticism and gave some intimations oi the right course to pursue. Sti-
mulatsd by his example more than one scholar followed np the attach.
The most important contribution of this kind was made by Jacob
Bernays in an article printed in the Rhenish Museum of 1847. This
able paper would have produced a greater effect than it did, 11 11 had
not been so soon superseded by Lachmann’s more complete and systema·
tioal work. This illustrious scholar great in so many departments oi
philology‚ sacred, classical and Teutonis, seems to have looked upon
Latin poetry as his peculiar province Lucretius his greatest work was
the main occupatiori oi the last five years ο1 his life, irom the autumn of
1845 1ο November 1850. Fortunately he had the iull use ior many
months ol the two heyden mss. His native sagneity, guided and sharp
ened by long and varied experience‚ saw at a glauce their relations to
each other and to the original from which they were derived, and made
clear the arbitrary way in which the common texta had been constructed.
His zeal warming as he advanced, one truth aiter another revealed itseli
to him, so that at length he obtained by successive steps a clear iusight
into the condition in which the poem leit the hands ο1 its author in the
most essential points. Like many other great scholare he seems to have
kept iew or no common-place books. Resolved to master his subject he
perused the grammarians and poeta and nearly the whole oi the older
writers in order 1ο illustrate Lucretius through them and them by
Lueretius, and the Latin language by all. He had an almost unaqualled
power ο1 grasping a subject in its widest extent and filling up the

. minutest details. One mark ο1 a great original critic, which eminently

belongs to Lachmann, is this: even when wrong, he puts into your
hands the best wespons ior reinting himself, and by going astray makes
the right path easier ior others to find. Another test is this, when his
influence extends iar beyond his immediate author. Now hardly any
work of merit has appeared in Germany since Lachmann's Lucretius in
any branch oi Latin literature without bearing on every page the impreas
