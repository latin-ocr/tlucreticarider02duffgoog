01 his example. When he is better known in England, the same result
will follow here. Though his Latin style is eminently clear lively and

appropriata, yet from his aim never to throw away words, as well as

11011 0 mental peculiarity 01 his, that he only cared 10 be understood by ·

those whom he thought worthy to understand him, he is often obscure
and oracular on a first reading. Had his commentar-y been twice the
length it is, it would have been easier to master. But when once fully
apprehended his words are not soon forgotten. His love 101 merit 01 011

kinds incites in him a zeal 10 do justice to all the old scholars who have
done anything 101 his author 3 while his scorn and hatred oi boastiul
ignorance and ignoble sloth oompel him to denounce those whom he con·
victs 01111010 offences. 11 010 instance, that 01 Forbiger, this sternness

passes into ferocity: most 01 his errors that scholar could hardly avoid
in the circumstances in which he was placed.

Hermann warns us, when we disagree with Lachmann, to think
twice lest we, not he, be 11 fault. His defects however must not be
passed over. While the most essential part 01 his work, the collation
01 the two Leyden mss, hasbeen performed with admirable skill and¹
industry, he has 101 been so happy in the use 01 secondary evidence, that
01 the Italian mss. and the older editions. Much he has taken on trust
on insufficient evidence, and much that he had before him he has not
always accurately used. Some proois 01 this have been given, more will
be seen below. But a still more serious (101001 must be told: he meant
his book 10 be a critical revision 01 the text, and 1011 10 others the task ‘
01 explaining and illustrating the meaning. So 101 good: but as the
text 01 01 author in the condition 01 1110101 Lucretius cannot be always
rightly constructed without 0 sufficient knowledge 01 his system and
its literature, he has 101 unirequently strangely blundered and grossly
corrupted the poet's words: 101 examples 01 this see 1 see-634 11 522
-529 10101011. v 513-516. His consummate knowledge 01 the Latin
language as well 0101 the manner 01 Lucretius in particular enables him
often to amend his author with great success. As he wishes too 10 pro
duce, where it is possible, an intelligible text, many 01 his corrections he
must himself have looked upon as only provisional. Yet his greatest
admirere must concede that he has not Madvig's ‘curiosa felicitas' in
emendation. He has however achieved a work which will 110010111-
mark 101 scholare as longas the Latin language continues to be studied‚
a work, perfidiae quod post 10110 arguet actua.

Jacob Bernays in 1852 edited a text 01 Lucretius 101· the Teubner
series. There can be little doubt that carried away hythe strength 01

is generally right; where he deserts him 101 0 conjecture 01 his own, he
is often very successful Had he prepared a more elaborate edition, as
