22 IMBODUOE'ION

he appears to have once had thoughts 01 doing, there is no doubt that
Lucretius would have owed him much. 'I'he impulse given by Lachmann
to the study of our poet has called forth numerous papers either inserted
in the German philological reviews or published by themselves Some
are of more, some of less importance: my notes will shew where Ι have
been indebted 10 them. One English publication of eminent merit, as
it criticises not the text of the poem, bnt its matter and poetical
Quum, shall be mentioned elsewhere.

To return now to the manuscripts whose history was sketched above.
Though I examined the two at [cydon for some days so long ago as
the autumn of 1849, what will now be said of them is borrowed from
Lachmann who had thern in his hands for six months and during that
time applied the whole force of his practised and penetrating intellect to
unravelling all their difficulties and obscuritiea Both, ss already men-
tioned, belonged to the magnificent collection 01 Isaac Vossius The

“ older and better 01 110 two is of the ninth century written in a clear and
beautiful hand: Icall it A. It has been corrected by two scribes at the
time that the ms. was written, as Lachmann tells us. One of these is of
great importance: in most essentia] points he agrees minutely with the
ms. of Niccoli‚ the oldest of the Italian mss.; and doubtless therefore
gives the reading 01 110 archetype. It will be seen in notes 1 how often
I make the united testimony of A and Niccoli to outweigh all the rest
The other Leyden rns. whichI call Bis of nearly equal importance: it
is 01 quarto size closely written iu double columns, apparently in the
tenth century. It is probable that it aud the ms. next to be mentioned
were copied from some copy of the archetype, not like A from the arche
type itself. Four porticus of the poem are omitted in their place, but
come together at the end in this order, 11 ver-806 ν 928-979 1 734
-785 11 253-304. Lachmann has demonstrated 1101110οθ sections
formed esch an entire leaf of the lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 are the
numbers of these leaves. Itis manifest then that after A was copied,
these leaves 01 110 archetype had fallen out 01 their places and 1000 put
together without order at the end, before B, or the original 01 Β, was
copied from it. More will 10 said 00 this point presently. B has had
several correctore, but all 01 110 1111 century; one a very brilliant critic
for 110 age, to whom are due many 01 110 lineet emendations in the poem,
as will be seen in notes 1. This ms. was once in the great monastery 01
St Bertin near St Omer. Turnebus collated itin Paris and his colla·
tion as we saw was used with much effect by Lambinus: it afterwards
carue 1010 the possession 01 Gerard John Vossius, Isaac’s father. A
large fragment of another ma closely resembling B in everything double
columns aud all, except 1101 11 10 said to be a small folio, not quarto in
shepe, is now 01 Oopenlragen: it contains hook 1 and 11 down 10456,
omitting howerer the same 00011000 as B, ria 1 134-181 and 11 253-
