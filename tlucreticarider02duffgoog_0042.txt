100. 11001 which B was taken. It usually goes by the name of the
Gottorpian fragment from the place where it once was. Ι have three ,
0011061000 01 16, 000 published by Henrichsen in 1846, another 10 the
handwriting of Nic. Heinsius, another in that of Isaac Vossius. For·
merly it had a very high reputation: in truth it much resembles, 110610
more carelessly written than B, and 10 0016001 01 much use, except once
or twice to confirm A against B. Strangely enough there are 10 61101
Vienna library fragments of a precisely similar ms containing large por-
tions of the later books, viz. 1164260111621 1001110110, omitting how-
ever in the proper place 11 110-000 exactly as B does3 then v1 743 60
6110006, then follow, precisely as 10 Β, 6110 four omitted portione given
above, proving this 60 110 copied 11001 the ms from which B was taken.
Naturally enough 611000 Vienna fragments were assumed 60 belong to one
006 the same ms. as the Gottorpian3 but Dr Ed Goebel, from whom I
11010 1101101106 this description of them, seems 60 prove 10 the Rhenish
Mus. 0 s. x11 p. 4491011. that the two portione now bound together are
01 different sizee 006 belonged to different 0100. However that may be,
the former part seems to be the 00010 10000 the Gottorpian, 006 the
· other if not the seme, 10 precisely the same in iuternal character3 00610
. either ease is 01 the same, thetis 01 very little value. Probably there-
fore a more accurate collation would hardly repay the labour.

All other mss. known to exist were, 00 1100 11000 already said, copied
modiately or immediately from Poggio’s lost ms. which must have re·
sembled A almost as closely as the Gottorpian resembles Β. The most

have known his writing better than anybody else. There are many cor·

have copied Poggio’s ms. 1016111011],006006601101010060 many changes.
