the other. These two therefore I have used 00 good examples of cor·
rected codices. From whom come the many excellent emendations oon-
tained in these mss. is quite unknown. Lachmann used a not very
complete collation 01 Flor. 31, and to it he attributes the corrections
which 111100 1011110 most part in common with the Cambridge and
doubtless some other mss. Having been told too by H. Keil from whom
he got 1110 0011011011 that it was written by Antonius Marii filius, 11011110
his commentary from one end to the other with the name of this worthy
Florentiae notary. I can only say that Ι compared it with ten or more
voluminous mss. written in magnificent style and signed by this man
between 1420 and 1451 all closely resembling each other ; and neither
in general appearance nor in the form of particular letters nor in their
abbreviatione have they any resemblance to the ms of Lucretius. This
scribe's name therefore I have excluded from my notes. 01 the other
Laurentian mss. 29 is 10 be noticed for the marginal annotatione of
Angelo Politian spoken 01 above and often referred to in notes l: it twice
over has this note ‘liber conventus Sancti Marci de Florentia ordinis
Praedicatorum habitus a publicis sectoribus pro libris quos sibi ab eodem
conventu commodatos Angelus Politianus amisit sen quiin morte Angeli
Politiani amissi sunt’. 321100 some learned marginal remarks on the
first book 110111 which I have derived some laets about Marullus. The

· six mss of the Vatican I collated as long ago as the autumn of 1849, bnt
not with much 0010 01 skill; yet it will be seen irom notes 1 that they
have been 01 considerable service to me: their marks are as follows, 3275

and 3276 Vatic. 640 Urbim 1136 and 1954 Othobon. and 1706 Regin,
at the bottom of the first page of which are the words ‘Nicolai Heinsii'.

As further helps I have had Gifanius’ ed. of 1595 with ms. notes by
Nic. Heinsius which I bought from H. G. Bohn many years ago: it will
be seen that I have derived from it some valuable emendations not in
Heinsius' adversaria nor elsewhere so far asI know. It has also a com-
plete collation of A all through, of Β in the first iour books, and 01 1110
Gottorpian fragment. It contains too 0 complete collation 01 the codex
Modii, which Heinsius denotes by s: he says 01 11 ‘variantes lectiones
excerptae sunt ex libello edito Paris. an. 1565 quem Fr. Modius cum ms.
suo contulit, ut ipse testatur fine lib. 1 inquiens: Collatus 011111 ma meo
1611111 1579 Colonioe': it was lent to Heinsius by Liraeus ; Liraeus
had it from Gruter, Gruter from N ansius, Nansius from Modius himself.
Heinsius says ‘codex Modii non est idem cum B Vossiano, nam pag. 8
[1 227] ubi ex Modiano notatum ad 1111111110, Vossianus ὁπ’. Heinsius
speaks I presumo of the small 21111011. ol Lambinus, as 1110 0110 which
Modius used: it has like others 111 lumino: 11 then Modius' codex 10 Β,
either he or Heinsius has made a gross mistake. I have noticed several
other instances, where 0 10 made to differ from Β ; but in these cases

Lambinus’ 21111 ed has the affl which Heinsius gives 100, 0011101
