Heinsius may have here been misled by Medius’ negligence. It would
seem certainly that a and B are the same: ii they are two, then their
agreement is very extraordinary, much closer than that between Β and
the Gottorpian fragment

I also possess a copy of Faber's Lucretius with a poor collation oi A
and B and the Gottorp. as well as many other notes and illustratione in
the writing of Isaac Vossius. Havercamp had a copy oi the same notes,
but has employed them with his usual carelessness. Notos l will shew
what important useI have made oi them: they have enabled me to strip
him oi several oi the most showy ieathers with which he had decked
himself either from negligence or worse. Spengel, Christ, Goebel and
some others have in various journals and publicatione made much ado
about a codex Victorianus as they call it, once belonging tc P. Victorius,
now in the Munich library, as if it were a rival, or nearly so, oi A and
B. From the readings cited Ι see clearly that it is a common Italian
fifteenth century ms. neither better nor worse than twenty others, much
resembling the Verona and Venice editions and ol no importance what
ever. [As the reader has been already told, Ι examined this manuscript
myseli at Munich during the summer oi 1865 and can confidently affirm
that what I said oi it is the truth. It is much interpolated: its correc-
tions are not so valuable as those ol Flor. 31 or Ϊ think oi our Cambridge
manuscript. Ι have recorded some oi its readings in my critical notes
under the term ‘M0n.', and have occasionally spoken oi it as the codex
Victorii. Strange that learned men should have taken so much trouble
about its own readings and said not a word oi the much more important
emendations oi Marullus which it contains. This is not the case with
Proi. Sauppe in the program spoken of above3 butI cannot help citing
from its first page a iew lines which I read with no slight surprise:
‘unum adde, quod ab aliis nondum quod sciam animadversum coniectu·
ram de victoriani codicis origine propositam valde confirmet. Post l. 3
enim v. 360 versus novem scripti sunt, quos delendos esse homo quidam
doctissimus in margine monuit, qui versus 403-411 per errorem hic il-
latos esse vidisset. ratione autem subducta inter v. 360 et 403 versus bis
vicenos senos interpositos esse invenimus, ut facile intelligamus in singu-
lis archetypi paginis versus vicenos senos scriptos luisse eiusque inter
scribendum cum unum vellet scriptorem victoriani duo lolia vertisse. in
archetypo vero oblongi C. Lachmannus ostendit p. 3. 49. 233. aliis locis
eandem versuum rationem fuisse'. Probably before this time the learned
writer will have discovered that his arithmeticis at fault and that he
has counted iortytwo as fifty-tw03 and that his theory is thus entirely
upset. But it is not for such a trifle as that, that I have quoted his
words. Does he really mean to essert that this Munich is not like every
other fifteenth century ms. a descendant oi the one brought into Italy by
Poggiol that the long lost archetype was preserved by some mysterious
