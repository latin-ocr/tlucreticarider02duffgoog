same number of lines in a page: oure had 26 lines in a page, excepting
only those which concluded a book. But remember there was a heading

or title at the beginning 01 each section; and each of these headings oc-
cupied a line. Lachmann brings many proofs of this being the number.
When this ms. was copied, it was clearly much torn and mutilated. It
was stated above that four portione, omitted in their place by B, come
together at the eud, and that these each formed a leaf of the archetype
which had fallen out 01 110 proper place. Each 01 these alone or with its
headings consiste of 52 lines. Then turn to note l on 1v aee-347
(323-347 ree-322) where this inversion iscxplained in the same way,
by the accident that is of a loose leaf being turned the wrong way: see
also note l 1011068-1075 01111 1094-1101,1111010 the mutilaticn is
accounted for in the same manner. Thus we obtain six certain land·
marks in different parts 01 the poem. The archetype therefore consisted
01300 pagos, or admitting, as seems to be an undoubted fact, that a
whole leaf is lost between vr 839 and 840, 01 302 3 of which the first was
not written upon, as well as 0110 101 some reason or other somewhere
between 1 105, which ends 0110 011110 10000 leaves at the end of B, and
1068 which, as shewn in note 1, begins a fresh leaf. Page 190 which
followed the end 01 1v was left blank. Imay also note that pp. 137 01111
191 contained an index of the headings 01 rv and v respectively, while
1110 headings 01 vr 010 crowded into the lower part 01 p. 249, the uppcr
part of which contained the last 13 lines 01 the text of v: see Lach. p.
398: although the different titles come in their places in these books 100,
00 well as in the first three which have 110 such index prefixed. Having
made for myself a list of these pagos after the rules stated in various
places by Lachmann, Ihave found it 01 great use, as the ends 01 111100
throughout the poem towards the bottom 01 the several righthand pagcs
had been specially exposed 10 mutilation in the danraged archetype.
Verses also omitted in their proper places were apt in this 00 111 other
mss. to be put afterwards at the bottom 01 pages. Besides the injurias
which it had received from accident or ill usage, cur archetype must
have been carelessly enough written, though A and B prove that it re
tained many valuable vestiges 01 great antiquity, especially in the spell-
ing 01 1101110, 01111 though there may have been few stages between it
and the age of the author. There isone point, the nature 01 the hiatus
after rv 126, as to which it is not easy to accept Lachmann's theory.
That there is a hiatus there, is indisputable and the special questions
connected with it are fully discussed in note l to that passage. As the
accidental 1000 01 0 whole leaf would 1101 01111 his system cf pages, 110
boldly declares that twenty-five verses and one heading have perished,
’ that is 0110 single page 01 0111 archetype. Now it is easy enough, 00 wc
have seen, to explain the accidental loss 01 0 leaf, hy which every subse·
quent copy must necessarily want the contents of that leaf: it is easy
