enough to conceive any one ms, A or B or Poggio’s, passing ovor by
mistake one wholo page But it is in tho highest degree unlikoly that
difforont copies, A B and Poggio's, neither of which as Lachmann admits
was copied from tho other, should all pass ovor a single page of thoir ori-
ginal; or that this single pago should bo wholly illegible, whilo that
which preceded and the reverso pago of tho samo loaf should be entirely
uninjured It seems to mo therefore much more natural to assumo that
our archetype cr ono of its predecessors accidentally omitted an uncertain
number of verses ; or rather that a whole leof of the archetype had been
lost, as after vl 839. lachmann’s system of pagination would then bo
set right in this way: only books 1v and v havo an indas capitam pre-
fixod filling one pago; for that of V1 as Ι havo said is crammod into tho
lower part cf tho last page of v: before this index in v Lachmann has
shown that the archetypo had one blank page. Assumo now that ono
pago was similarly left blank before tho index of 1v and all will bo right:
tho pages of tho archetype would thon be raised to 304. Tho indes copi»
twa prefixed tc νι Ι accidentally omitted to notice in former editions, as
it had no bearing on tho question of pagos Tho assumption here made
which is commended by Mr Pollo, but blamed by Mr Susomihl in philo
log. xxlx p. 427 foll, Ι still think probable. Tho latter asks what con·
coivable reason there could have boon for the two blank pagos before v,
except to begin tho now book with a new leaf, as was dono with all the
rest. Why, 1 which had no index prefixed began on tho second page oi
a loaf; so did 111, which had no such indox; so did V1 whose indox is
crowded together in the manner spoken of. Othor mss. such as tho me-
dicean of Virgil, soom to have no preference for beginning a book on a
new leaf. Why tho two pagos wero left for tho index between ιν and v
I do not know, any more than why apage was left vacant somewhoro bo
tweon 1 785 and 1068: it had something to do perhaps with calculatione
about tho parchment required. Ι was going tc say more, but forbear to
enlarge on sc fruitless a topic.

But wo aro able to advance even beyond tho archetype: in many
parts of tho poom thero aro manifest undoubted interpolations, which
must havo boon inserted by some reador who wished at ono timeto con-
firm what is said, at another to convict it of inconsistonoy and the like.
Gonomlly, not always, those passages aro repetitions of genuino passages ;
sometimes thoy consist of several, sometimes of asinglo verso: 144-
49 and 111 806-818 aro good and incontrovcrtiblo exemplos. But
enough is said of those throughout our notes. Lachmann however still
unsatisfied has not paused oven here, but has gono up to the vory times
of the poot. N o careful reader will refuso to admit that ho has proved
not a few passages, some of thom among tho fincst in tho poem, to have
boen subsequont additions made by the author, which he did not livo to
ombody properly with tho rost of his work. Lachmann has gono too far ;
