poet, inserted 11111 same principle as the longer sections discussed
above: these too the first editor, faithfully preservingeverything in his
copy, but not oaring always to find the right place for what the author

left ambiguous, has inserted 111 11 11111 order. Add to these v 437- .

442 which the context could dispense with : these vss. are found out of
place in Macrobius as in our mss. This increases the probability that
they were out of their proper order from the first, two apparently inde-
pendent authorities Macrobius and our archetype quoting them in the
same way. Perhaps these single 111. might be added to the list, 1v 202,

205, v1 957, 1225, 1237, 1270 as they might all be dispensed with„ .

Inok too at 1v 129-142, so strangely disordered in the mss: 133-135
may be all marginal additions by the author afterwards wrongly placed
by the editor. The ms. arrangement of 1v 299-348 has been already
accounted for. If all these passages are subtracted, there will then be
left a not very unusual number of single verses transposed by the ordi·

111] negligence of copyists The numbers occasionally given onthe 1111 ,

haud of the page denote of course 111 order of the lines in mss which Inch-
mann follows in his edition: where spurious vsa of the mss are omitted
from the text, he still allows them to count. For obvious reasons Ι
have followed him in this, as he will be the future standard of compari·
son, and there is great advantage in a uniform numbering of the verses.

Since many special questions of orthography 111 notioed as they Ἴ

occur in the notes, I should have thought it unnecessery to say more in
this place than that in essential points I follow Lachmann, if it were not
for the apparent unwillingness of scholars in this country to accept even
the smallest change in what they look upon 11111 usual or conventional
rules of spelling. The notion of any uniform conventional spelling is
quite a chimera: Inever find two English editors following any uniform
system ; nay the seme editor will often differ in different parts of the
same book. But whence comes this ‘conventional' system, so far as it
does exist? from the meritorious and considering their position most
successful endeavours of the Italian scholars in the fifteenth century to
get rid of the frightful mass 11 barbarisms which the four or five pre-
ceding centuries had accumulated. They sought indeed to introduce

rigorous uniformity in cases where variety was the rule of the ancients; ¹

and though these cases embraced only 1 few general heads, they yet
comprised a great multiplicity of particular instanoes, because involving
the terminatione of cases, the assimilation of propositione in compound
verbs and the like. But where there wes only one right course, they

generally chose it; yet from the 11111 confusion into which 111 111 11 111 .

aspirato had fallen, their own language having entirely lost it in sound,
but at this time retained it in spelling; from the almost complete iden-

tity both in sound and writing 111 and thefore 1, and 111 like, they ,

never could tell whether humor or 11111, tuturus 11111111111111111 or
