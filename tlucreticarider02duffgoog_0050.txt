spaciwn, 1116111 or spatas was eorrect3 and consequently as 1 rule chose
the wrong. Their general principles however were not accepted by the
most thoughtful scholare in any age, so far at least 11 concerned the text
of ancient authors, unless it be during a part of the present century;
neither by an Avancius in the 15th nor by 1 Lambinus or Scaliger in
the 16th nor by a Gronovius in the lith nor by a Bentley in the 18tn
Yet this system gradually established itself, because it came to be used
by scholare in their own writings, some of the barbarisms being gradu·
ally eliminated ; new ones however being introduced, such as walum
coena moereo sylva 1111116 for caelum ceno maereo siloa cetero in order to
derive them preposterously from Greek words: Marullus, as we said
above, writes syloa and hymbrae.

Many attempts were made in various directions to change this state
of things: the best and most systematic was that of Ph. Wagner in his
orthographia Vergiliana published in 1841. With admirable industry
he amassed all the evidence afforded by the medicean and, so far as it
was accessible to him, of the other ancient mss. of Virgil. As these, like
other old mss. are 11 1 rule very tenacious of the true spelling in those
cases where there is only one right method, he performed this part of his
work with eminent success, and still remains one oi the best authorities
on the subject. In those other cases however referred to above, in which
variety is the rule of the ancients and which include a great multitude
of particular instances, he has chosen to abendon the saie ground of
evidence and experience and has made Virgil write what he decided on
a priori principles he must have written. This seems to me the reason
why his system was not more generally followed. Still less satisfactory
was Madvig's spelling in his de finibus published in 1839 : it was utterly
unlike that. of the mss. and yet in many points it was not what Cicero
used, in still more you could not be sure whether it was what he used
or not. Here too Lachmann bringing into play his extraordinary ‘power
of asking the right question' and joining with it a minute knowledge of
the whole evidence upon the subject, saw at once what could be obtained
and what could not, and shaped his course accordingly. The Mydon
mss. of Lucretius, imperfect in many respects, are on the whole admira
ble in their orthography, at 16111 equal to any of the mss. of Virgil, con-
firming them in what is true and confirmed by them in turn: in some
nice points, such as the frequent retention of the enclitic st, they far
surpass them. 'With their aid he was able to confirm those improve
ments in spelling which Wagner had so well established in opposition to
the system in common use. But in regard to the other class of words in
which the usage of the ancients varied in different ages or even in the
same age, he did not dogmatically determine what his author wrote and
thus close the door to all future change 3 but knowing that certainty was
not here attainable, he careiully siited the evidence offered by his mss.
