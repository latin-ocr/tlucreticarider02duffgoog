and made the best approximation he could to what his author might have
’ written, always taking the most ancient form 161 which his authorities
supplied any testimony direct 61 indirect. Thns the question was not
foreclosed; nor were we left to vague generalities, but a firm historice]
groundwork was gained upon which future improvements might be built,
if better evidence hereafter offered itself. Lachmann then in this, as in
so many other departments of philology, seems at once to have produced
conviction in the minds 61 116 majority of the most thoughtful scholare,
in GermanyI mean ; for in our own country most seem to scout the
question as unworthy 61 serious attention: a great mistake; for Latin
orthography is a most interesting and valuable study 16 11666 who care
to examine it, and touches in a thousand points the history grammar and
pronunciation 61 116 language. Let me give two examples 61 116 effect
at once produced by Lachmann. Otto Jahn in 1843 published his
elaborate edition 61 Persius in which he adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though he had so many excellent mss. 16 guide him
to a better course: iu 1851, the year 61161 Lachmann’s work came out,
he published the text 61 116 Juvenal aud followed in it most minutely
the principles of Lachmann3 aud fortunately he had a most excellent
authority in the codex Pithoeanus; so that the spelling is probably not
very far removed from the author’s own. In the years just preceding
Lachmann Halm published several orations 61 Cicero with elaborate
critical Latin notes: and yet, though his spelling was somewhat better
than that of J ahu’s Persius, itis still essentially ‘conventional’ and arbi-
trary: in the years following Lachmann he published a series 61 school
editions of Cicero's orations with brief German notes, aud now in these
the spelling was wholly modelled on the system pursued by Lachmann.
The same system too he has carried out in those volumes of the elaborate
edition 61 Oicero edited by him aud Baiter, which came out after Lach-
mann's Lucretius. Stimulated by the examples 61 Madvig Ritschl and
Lachmann the rising generation of German scholars has pursued the
critical study 61 Latin with eminent success 3 and nearly all 61 them fol-
low in orthography the guidunce 61 Lachmann. This system then may
fairly I think be now regarded astho true ‘conventional’ system 3 for
surely the Lachmanns and Ritschls 61 116 nineteenth century have 6
161161 right to dictate to us in the present day what shall 16 accepted 66
‘conventional' thau the Poggius and Vallas 61 116 fifteenth. Since my
first edition came out, Madvig has published the last books 61 his text 61
Livy, 61 which there exists but a single and very ancient ms. : these he
has edited in a form differing from that 61 the other books, and has now
given his very weighty authority in favour 61 adhering to the spelling 61
the oldest mss, with some reservatione which I do not understand. And

now too in his new edition 61 the de finibus he has entirely abandoned
the orthography 61 116 other:
