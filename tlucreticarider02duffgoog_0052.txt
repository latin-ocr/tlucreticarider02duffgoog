In following Lachmann then I am sure that Ι have authority on my
side; I believe that Ι have reason as well. In those cases indeed to
which Ι have already referred, where the universal testimony of inscrip
tiens and of mss. beyond a certain age proves that there is only one right
’ way and about which the best scholare are all now agreed, there cannot
be any doubt what course should be taken: we 'must write querella
loquella luellu sollers sollemnis sollicito Iuppiter littera quattuor stuppa
lceumirra3 on the other hand mdiu eoueeto conexus eouiti colemus coniveo
conubium belua boec saccus litus and the like; condicio solacium, aetius
aetus (adj.) autumnus attola: in many of them an important principle
is involved: obeying the almost unanimous testimony of our own and
other good mss. we cannot but· give umerus umor and the lilre: also
hiemps. Ihave heard it asked what then is the genitive of hiemps: to
which the best reply perhaps would be what is the perfect of sucw or
supine of eruo. The Latius wrote hiemps, as they wrote eruptum sumpsi
sumptum and a hundred such forms, because they disliked uc and s ort
to come together without the intervention of a p sound3 and ourmss. all
attest this: tempto likewise is the only true form, which the ltalians in
the l5th century rejected for teuto. Then mss. and inscriptions prove
that cl took an u before it, mudum quendum euudm and the like, with
the exception of circuendo in which the mss. both of Lucr. and Virgil
always retain the m: and generally, though not invariably, m on the
other hand remained before q: quemquam tuaquom and so on ; though
the new corpus inscrip. Lat. has Ι find uunquam, and so has Augustus
in his res gestae, but quotiescumque. Thon always quicque quicquam
quicquid (iudei), but generally quidquid (relative), though quicquid is
found in the lex Rubria and once in our AB: always percmo iuteremo
ueqleqo iutelleqo etc. Above all we must scout such barbarisms as coelum
uweshu sqleu caetera nequicquam. In these points Wagner is as good a
guide as Lachmann3 but in regard to the cases in which ancient usage
varied shall we follow tho former who deserts the mss. for preconceived
general rules, or Lachmann who here also is content to obey the best
evidence he can getf Ι have unhesitatingly come over to the views of
the latter: ‘hypotheses non fingo' should be the rule in this as in other
matters. As said above, all these uncertain spellings fall under a very
few general heads. One of these is the assimilation or non-assimilation
of prepositions: iupero represents the etymology, impero the pronuncia-
tion of the word. From the most ancient period of which we have any
record-centuries before Cicero or Lucretius, a compromise was made be-
tween these opposing interests: words in common use soon began to
change the consonant, those in less common use retained it longer. In
the first volume of the corpus inscrip. Lat, the most recent of which
are as old as the age of Lucretius, most of them much older, canpe,
rator occurs 26 times, and is always spelt with m, proving that in a
