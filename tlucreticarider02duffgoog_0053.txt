word, which must daily have been in everybody's mouth, etymology in
remote times yiclded as was natural to sound: imperium again occurs
three, inparium six times, being doubtless in somewhat less common use.
Now in Lucretius imperium impero or imperito occurs six timec, and
the msa always spell with m, and so Lucretius spelt I have no doubt:
indeed many oi these common words the silver age I believe more
frequently wrote with u, than did that of Cicero. Then Virgil uses tvn-
periuru 40 times; and Ribbeck’s capital mss. have m in every instance,
except M which twice has iup, though one 01 these two cases is at least
doubtful: for Aen. viu 381 Fogginius prints imperiis. Yet in defiance
ol all this evidence Wagner gives us inperium, surely 'without reason on
any view of the case ; for the foundation on which we must build is thus
withdrawn from under our feet. Το take another common instance,
cornmuto occurs9 times in the corpus inscrip. and always with uc 3 12 times
in Lucretius and always with ru. Other words are more uncertain: we
lind in the mss. impius and iupius, immortalis and iuniortalis, 0001ῲο00
and colligere, compleo aud coeptio, and so with other propositione, ab, ob,
'sula ad: all tending to prove that usage was in most words uncertain
Again we have caste, and euto, 0000100, exulto capiro cupecto cet, s being
generally omitted ; and this agrees with Quintilian 1 7 4who implies
that it was a learned affectation 01 some to write exspecto in order to dis
tinguish erc and specto from erc and pecto; it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. of Virgil furnish precisely the same testimony
as those of Lucretius, yet Wagner in all such cases writes eus: surely
we should keep eu where the mss. keep it, cus where they have cus: and
so with supter or subter, suptilis or subtilis, ah- 01 ap, ob· or op, aab· or
sup, succ· or susc, and the like: appareo occurs ten times in Lucr. and
is always spelt thus by our mss. : so apparo, appello (both l and 3 conj.);
but adpetitur and always adporto, adporto or reiparte, in which words the
separate force of the preposition continued to be felt: in exact conform· ‚
ity with this the first volume of the corp. inscr. has twenty times appareo
and also apparitor, proving that in the earliest times the prepos. had
been assimilated in this common technical word: thus too in the 21 in-
stanccs oi appareo in Virgil all Ribbeck’s mss. always have app. except
M once, Aen. XI 605, misled by the usage of its age: comp. the sugges-
tive remark of Servius to Aen. 1616 ‘applicut: secundum praesentem
usum per dprima syllaba scribitur: secundum antiquam orthographiam
...per p’: yet in defiance of all this Wagner makes Virgil always write
adparco and the like. We find haud and haut, and sometimes aliut att
quit quicquit and the like, sound and etymology carrying on an undecided
battle in the mss. of Lucretius, as in inscriptions and elsewhere: adque
is sometimes but rarely found, sound having here aa might be expected
gained the victory: Wagner cannot be right in always forcing adque on
Virgil. Lucretius seems to have recognised only scd: he once has 010100,
