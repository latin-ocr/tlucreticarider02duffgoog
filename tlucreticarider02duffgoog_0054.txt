and once praescribta: see notes 2 to v1 92: in such forms sound must
have et an early period prevailed; and b d y gave way to p t c before s
and t: lapsus for labssn is the same principle as res (reos), rerri (recsi)
written sometimes recni, rectum from repo: to judge from the best mss.
labsus and the like became again much more commori in the silver age.
Mommsen has recently published an admirable copy and exposition of
the res gestae of Augustus from the Ancyra monument. Augustus was
somewhat of a purist in spelling and cashiered sn officer for using in a
dispatch the vulgariam isse (notiore) instead of ipse. His system quite
bears out what has just been said: he always writes imperium and impe-
rator; he has immortalis, but inmissus3 impensa, while the heading of
the work, not written by him, but perhaps by Tiberius, has inpensa:
generally cudeqa and conlegium, but once collegium and collaticiae 5 esili-
urn, but restinguere5 on the other hand scnsiens as well as securas, prov-
ing that n and ns were identical: he writes appellauerunt ; but adque
the only time he uses the word.

Another question involving a multitude of details is the use oi ·is or
-es in the accus. plur. of participles and adjectives and substantives
whose gen. plur. ends in ium, as well as of some other classes, doloris or
dolores, maioris or rnniores: here too Wagner involves himself in inex-
tricable perplexities by his eclectio system, when his mss. were admirable
guides, had he chosen to follow thern. The mss. of Lucretius are no less
admirable and probably represent very fairly the author’s own usage:
they offer ·is five times out oi six; and es is somewhat more common in
substantives in very general use, as iynes uires aures. Inscriptions quite
bear out our mss. 3 and the sole relic of Latin yet disinterred from Her·
culaneum contains this v. Utroque sollemnis iterans revocaverat orbes.
Perta recently printed in the Berlin transactione the few remaining
leaves of a ms. oi Virgil, which he assigna to the age oi Augustus and
¹ which may really be of the second or third century: we there find the
aee. plur. of adjectives and participles ending 18 times in -is, 3 times in
es pares feline amantes ; of substantivas we find sonoris, but itimes
eires, and artes messes crates classes aves, quite confirming the testimony
of our A and B. Varro de ling. Lat. v111 66 writes item quod in patrico
casu boe yenus dispariliter dicatur civitatum parentum et civitatium pa-
rentium: in accusandi ios montes fontes et ios montis fontis, and in
Lucr. 11 587 we find potestates, v 1239 potestatis: then ib. 67 he says
quid potest similius esse quarn gens mens densi quom iorurn casus patri-
cus et accusativus in multitudine sint disparilis; narn a prinis fit gen-
tium et gentis, utrobique ut sit i, ab secundo mentium et mentes, utin
priore solo sit i; ab tertio dentum et dentes, ut in neutro sit i; well our
mss. six times have the acc. gentis, hever gentes ; dentes four times,
never dentis3 utentes five times, once only, 11 620, nantis. As for the
nomin. plur. of such words, Varro l. l. 66 says sine reprehensione culpo alii
