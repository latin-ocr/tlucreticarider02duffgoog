36 'inruonucnoa'

dicum in simulari huc ovi et avi, alii hoc ove et ave, in multitudiuis huc
puppis restis et fue puppes restes: the fragment of Virgil just cited hae
the nomin plur. ymtria and mab, though we saw it had masaa in the
aecus: in accordance then with these high authorities the msa of Lacr.
not unfrequently retain this nomin in «ie, which it would be monstrans
to extirpate: I have always therefore kept it. In precise conformity
with Lucr. Augmtus has in the accus. ageretis and laternae, finis and
fines, comulas and once corwulis: once too the nomin. pluria. On the
other hand he always uses the accus. parua, departing in thia word frum
the rulo of Varro and Lacr. We see from the eorpus inser. that eia ἆυ
-ea were all in uae: it is probable that Lucr. occasionally employed the
termination eie, intermediate in sound between aa and ἐκ but, if so,
his manuscripts have left few or no traces, and it would be most perverse
to follow Aventius Wakefield and others in thmsting it into his verses
in seaaon and ont of aeaaon: v 1280 Β hae mmwbb, perhaps from
Lucr. ε Augustus more than once has thie ab in the ahl. plur„ quadri·
geio, eruenta and the inscription in his honour still existing on the
arch of Rimini erected in 727, midway therefore in time between his
ree gestae and Luca, hau celeberrimis, cuia, midinis. A and B have
however not a few indicatione expresaed or implied of the ending -ea't eee
note 2 to 111 97 maloi: these have of uvaurae been carefully preserved.
On another question, comprehending a multitude of particular in-
stanam, Ι have followed Lachmann and our mss. which here too are on
the whole excellent guidae: Ι speak of the vowel or consonant u followed
by another u. The old Latine appear to have been unable to pronounoe
wu3 and therefore the ancient o long kept its place after u3 or for quc
orq was used 2 quom qum or cum, never quum3 linquant linquat or lia
oman aequantur, sequntur or uocantum equor (nom.) equa or acue5 volgus
transimennum and so on They appear to have began soonest to
tolerate uu in terminatione, when both were vowels, auus tuus and tbe
like. Now tlie anas. of Lucretius have retained in very many instanoes
davone volnus volyo vivont cet. ; equor (nom.) and acue, acuon, oecum3 re
lisaqucnt relinqunt or reflectunt oftener than relinquunt, eo sequantur
recuratur secutus locuntur locutum but with Lachmann I retain the uu,
when tlie niae. offer it, in order not to get lost on a sea of conjectura}
uncertainty like Wagner aad some othere, who not only desert mse. but
in many cates intrude a spelling older than the age of their author: thus
Augustus has rirma rinna cortuum (not once -uo or -vo); why not then
Virgil, or at least Varius and Tuccal The mee. of Lucretius are also
very pertinacious in retaining the genuine old forme reicit eicit or eiecit
cet. and never olfering raucit eiicit and the like: Grai Graia, not Graii
Grua't'a But further details on the most interesting points of the ancient
orthography will be found in various parte of my notes Again in those
many cauea where the Q intermediate between u and i and the
