spelling therefore uncertain, such as the penult of superlativas and cer-
tain other adjectives, and words like lubet or libet, dissipat or dissupat,
qevudrupee or quadripes and many others, Ι have of course submitted to

the guidance of our msa which only once for instance have u in the su·
perl. and once muaufeate, and twice offer orbito, not arbuta. Augustus,
having learnt it probably in boyhood from the all-accomplished dictator,
for whose apprehension nothing was either too little or too great and
who, Gellius tells us, first introduced the i for u in superlativas, invaria
bly writes frequentissimus septimus vieeueirnua, as well as finitimus mcv
ulliae: comp. what Suetonius says of his use of almus for sumus, pro
bably from a wish 1ο be consistent. He would scarcely have thanlred
Varius and Tucca for bringing him the Aeneid ambellished with Wag-
ner'a morumve, septumus and the like, introduced so often in spite of his
mss. [Both forms are found in the same sentence lex colon. Genetivae
c. 66 (Ephem. Epigraph. vol. 111 p. 93) optimu lege optumo iure]
I have likewise followed AB in the adoption of e or o in vertere or
vortere and the like: e is naturally the more common, yet vorti vorsum
divorsi vortitur convortere vortere ere all found: also in reading reddunda
gignundis dicundum ceruuudv'faeiuudum agundis cet. or the more usual ’
agendum quaerendum cet. Do I then claim in all these doubtful cases
to repmduce the spelling of Lucretius or his first editorl Certainly not;
but still in most of them Lucretius and his contemporaries undoubtedly
allowed themselves much latitudo, and Ι have not intentionally permit
ted anything to remain which might not have been found in one or other
ms. before the death of Virgil. By adhering tenaciously to the mss¹
where not demonstrably wrong one gains a firm resting place from which
to make further advances, if better evidence offer itself. However that
may be, Ι cannot bring myseli to accept the arbitrary and eclectio system
of a Wagner, much less the hideous barbarisms of a Wakefield; nor on
the other hand, after feasting on the genereus cereels of a Lachmann and
a Ritschl, can Ι stomach the ‘conventional’ husks and acorna of the
[taliane of the 15111 century. At the same time it will be seen that my
spelling differs less from this system, than does that of Wagner in his
standard textui 1841, or even his subsequent modification of that text
for common use which Prof. Conington has adopted in his Virgil.
